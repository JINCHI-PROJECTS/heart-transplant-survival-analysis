# Survival Analysis of Stanford Heart Transplant Data

This project reanalyzes survival outcomes in heart transplant patients using STATA. It includes Kaplan-Meier curves, hazard functions, and Cox proportional hazards modeling.

## Methods
- Time-varying covariates
- Subgroup analysis by prior surgery

## Software
- STATA 17
- KM plots and hazard curves

## Key Finding
Transplant improves survival descriptively but not statistically significant in Cox regression.
